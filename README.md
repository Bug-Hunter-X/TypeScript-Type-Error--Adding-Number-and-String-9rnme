# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript type error: attempting to perform an arithmetic operation on incompatible types (a number and a string).

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file demonstrates a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of TypeScript's type system in catching potential runtime errors during development.
